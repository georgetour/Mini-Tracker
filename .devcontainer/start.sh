#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Starts Mini Tracker inside a devcontainer or Codespace.
#
# A script rather than a one-liner in devcontainer.json because there are three things to get
# right, and each was learned from it going wrong:
#
#   1. Start only if nothing is answering. postAttachCommand runs on every attach, and a browser
#      reconnecting counts — the second run bound a port the first was holding and died with a page
#      of stack trace, which is what a visitor saw.
#   2. Ask the port, not the process list. This script's own command line contains the project
#      name, so a pgrep would match itself and never start anything.
#   3. --urls on the command line, not ASPNETCORE_URLS in the environment. `dotnet run` applies
#      launchSettings.json, whose applicationUrl is http://localhost:5249, and that overrides the
#      ambient variable — leaving the app bound to loopback with nothing for the forwarder to see.
