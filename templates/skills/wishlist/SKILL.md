# Wishlist

## Description

As a customer, I want to save products for later, so that I can plan purchases I am not ready to make
yet instead of losing track of them between visits.

This skill covers saving and removing products from a personal wishlist, and being notified when a
saved product's price drops. It depends on `catalog` for product identity and current price, and its
price-drop alert is a separate trigger from the order-lifecycle emails `notifications` sends — nothing
here fires off an order at all.

Owned by US-13 (Wishlist).

## Tasks

> One deliverable per task; each tagged with the acceptance criteria it satisfies.

1. **Add and remove wishlist items** — a signed-in customer can add a product to their wishlist and
   remove it later; the list persists across sessions. *(→ AC1)*
2. **Notify on price drop** — when a wishlisted product's price falls below what it was when saved (or
   below its last-known price), notify the customer. *(→ AC2)*
3. **Tests** — verify a wishlisted item persists. *(→ AC1)*

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Adding a product to the wishlist persists it against the customer's account; it is still
  there on a later visit or session.
- [ ] AC2: A price drop on a wishlisted product triggers a notification to the customer who saved it.

## Technical Reference

See `@detailed-designs/wishlist.md` for the wishlist data model, how a product's price history is
tracked well enough to detect a drop (rather than just comparing to the current catalog price at
notification time), and how the price-drop alert is delivered.

## Notes / Gotchas

- This story is **On Hold** — deliberately paused, not abandoned. Neither task has started; `US-05`
  (Navigation Menus) already links to it from the signed-in menu and is expected to degrade gracefully
  rather than 404 while this stays on hold.
- Detecting a price drop needs a price *history*, not just the current catalog price — without a
  snapshot of the price at save time (or at last check), there is nothing to compare a new price
  against. This is infrastructure `catalog` doesn't currently provide and will need to before task
  13.1 can start.
- Removing an item should be immediate and not require confirmation friction — a wishlist a customer
  can't easily prune becomes a list they stop using.
- Price-drop notification is a distinct event type from anything `notifications` currently handles
  (order-confirmed, order-shipped); reuse its delivery mechanism once it exists rather than building a
  second, parallel email-sending path here.
